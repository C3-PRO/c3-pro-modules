  "description": "Combining üî•FHIR and ResearchKit, the iOS framework allows you to use FHIR `Questionnaire` resources directly with ResearchKit and will return FHIR `QuestionnaireResponse` that you can send to your server. In addition, a FHIR `Contract` resource can be used to carry trial eligibility requirements and define content to be shown during consenting. Subsequently, the contract can be ‚Äúsigned‚Äù with a FHIR `Patient` resource and returned to your server, indicating consent.",
